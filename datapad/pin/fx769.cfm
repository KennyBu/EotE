<p>The FX-7 medical assistant droid was a medical droid manufactured by Medtech Industries as part of the FX-series of surgical assistants and nursing droids. Typically, an FX-7 droid cost 3,500 credits. After the FX-7's manufacturing ended, it was only available as used by the time of the Galactic Civil War.</p>
<p>It was equipped with a wide array of sophisticated appendages. Twenty retractable manipulator arms were the norm, but because medical needs varied from system to system, Medtech specifically designed the arms to be modular. Its main manipulator arm, which could extend up to one meter, was located near the upper half of the body, featuring a removable grasper able to be replaced with specific tools. The droid's cap-like head, which could rotate 360 degrees, featured a cluster of sophisticated medical sensors and diagnostic equipment.</p>
