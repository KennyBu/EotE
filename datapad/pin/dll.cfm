<p>The Drendan Load-lifter was a bulky droid designed to move heavy equipment around. Slow and cumbersome, the Load-lifter had little utility. Because of their size, they effectively blocked shipboard corridors, and were usually confined to maintenance or storage bays. Only in the event of an emergency did they venture out of their assigned areas.</p>
