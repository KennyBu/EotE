<p>3D-4K is a Administration Droid, charged with the general maintenance and upkeep of the Gavos Mining Operation.  He's been there since the mine was first opened, 20 years past.</p>
<p>The 3D-4X administrative droid was created by Genetech Corporation in an effort to compete with their rival Cybot Galactica's hold on the galactic protocol droid market. </p>
<p>Genetech Corporation's 3D-4X administrative droid was a third-degree humanoid-shaped unit that stood 1.7 meters tall
 and was possessed of a torso, two arms, two legs, and a cranial unit. The 3D-4X's cranial unit was shaped like an
 inverted test tube, and contained the droid's vocabulator, and a single photoreceptor mounted off-center on the unit's
 right side.</p>
