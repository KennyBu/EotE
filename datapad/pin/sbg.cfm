<p>The Gavos Storm Barrier is comprised of a set of eight double redundant ISD-72x Dome Deflector Generators, circling the mine in a hundred kilometer radius.  Each generates a semi-permeable storm barrier - in essence, a giant windbreak of pure energy.  The generators work in concert to direct and slow the raging winds around the facility.
</p>
<p>The double redundant nature of this installation allows for up to four of the shields to fail while still offering minimal safety regulated coverage to the station.</p>
<p>The storm barriers do nothing to clean the atmosphere, so the mining buildings are sealed, and the landing pads have pressure curtains to allow a breathable atmosphere.</p>
