<p>MerenData Company Notice:<br>
<strong>"Please return your EV to your MerenData dealer for double your money back. 
We are also offering a 10,000-credit reward for information leading to the whereabouts of other EV supervisor droids."</strong></p>

<p>Rumors are that the EV series is actually installed with a Tagge MDF motivator, an illegal chipset designed for interrogation and torture units in the black market.  Approach EV units with great caution.</p>
