<p>The COO Series of Industrial Automaton Droids is a chef series.  Manufactured with 6 appendages, the droid can run a full kitchen operation, preparing individual meals for a full household, or, in the 8x series, a buffet style menu for commercial or public institutional kitchens.</p>
<p>With a rudimentary chipset, the COO is limited to recognizing up to 16 individuals, and storing up to 256 "favorites" or allergies for each of it's remembered clients.  The storage unit contains over 800 recipies, in the species cartridge of your choice!</p>
<p>The COO series does have a vocalizer, and can be either programmed or taught several short greetings and responses in Galactic Basic.</p>
